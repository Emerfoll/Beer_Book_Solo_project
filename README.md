## Description

_Prime Digital Academy: Solo Project_
_Duration: 2 weeks_

Beer Book is a web application designed with the beer drinker in mind. I developed this app becuase there have been too many times I have had the same beer and too many times where I did not like said beer. I wanted to come up with an app that lets me track any beers I have tried and lable/orginize them in lists that I can refer too later.

I can also use Beer Book to track new beers I would like to try, that way I can pull up my list for some insperation instead of standing in the beer isle for 20+ min trying to decide what to try.

## Usage

- Create a user/password
- Head over to the new beer page by clicking the "Find a New Beer" tab at the top to search the list of beers and start adding them to your lists.
- To add a beer to one of your lists simply click the "Select List" drop down and click the list you would like to add it too.
- Don't worry if you can't find the beer you're looking for. Click the "Add Beer" tab to get to the page where you can add anything you would like and even tie a url image of it so you have a visual reference. (These beers will be stored here in the add beer page)
- On the "My Lists" page is where you will find your BOIs (beers of interest)
- The default list is the view all list and you can go to specific lists by clicking the select dropdown and clicking the list you would like to view.

## Next steps

The next features I would like to implament would be an API for the search function in the "New Beer" page and a way to recomment new beers to try based on ones in the users "liked" and "did not like" lists.
