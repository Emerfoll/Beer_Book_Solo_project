## Description

_Prime Digital Academy: Solo Project_
_Duration: 2 weeks_

Beer Book is a web application designed with the beer drinker in mind. I developed this app becuase there have been too many times I have had the same beer and too many times where I did not like said beer. I wanted to come up with an app that lets me track any beers I have tried and lable/orginize them in lists that I can refer too later.

I can also use Beer Book to track new beers I would like to try, that way I can pull up my list for some insperation instead of standing in the beer isle for 20+ min trying to decide what to try.

## Next steps

The next features I would like to implament would be an API for the search function in the "New Beer" page and a way to recomment new beers to try based on ones in the users "liked" and "did not like" lists.
